     *  To compare, we need to know what's factors to use, this can be natural order,
     *  or we can define custom comparaison either by implementing Comparable<T> interface
     *  or using a lambda expression
     * 
     *  Concepts:
     *      - Comparable : Comparable is an interface defining a strategy of comparing an object with
     *                     other objects of the same type. This is called the class's â€œnatural ordering
     *      
     *      - Comparator : The Comparator interface defines a compare(arg1, arg2) method with two arguments 
     *                      that represent compared objects, and works similarly to the Comparable.compareTo() method.
     * 
     *   So why use a Comparator if we already have Comparable?
     * 
     *   There are several reasons why:
     *       
     *   - Sometimes we can't modify the source code of the class whose objects we want to sort, thus making the use of Comparable impossible
     *   - Using Comparators allows us to avoid adding additional code to our domain classes
     *   - We can define multiple different comparison strategies, which isn't possible when using Comparable
